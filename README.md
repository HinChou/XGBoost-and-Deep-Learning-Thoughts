### Question:
Is LSTM better than CNN or RNN for time series analysis?

## Combining XGBoost and Deep Learning Algorithms:
* Use boosting algorithm for framework. 
* Set weak learner as one hidden layer ANN(LSTM, CNN or RNN). 
* Set low learning rate and use CV or OOB for predictive ability testing.
