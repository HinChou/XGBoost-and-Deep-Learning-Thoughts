# XGBoost-and-Deep-Learning-Thoughts
Comparison Between XGBoost and Deep Learning Algorithms(LSTM, CNN and RNN, etc.), and Create New Formats Which Combined Both.

## XGBoost:
Search wikipedia and github

## Deep Learning Algorithms:
Search wikipedia and github
### Question:
* Is LSTM better than CNN or RNN for time series analysis?
* What is GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks)?
* What is collaborative filtering recommendation?

## Combining XGBoost and Deep Learning Algorithms:
* Use boosting algorithm for framework. 
* Set weak learner(aka base leaner) as one hidden layer ANN(LSTM, CNN or RNN). 
* Set low learning rate and use CV or OOB for predictive ability test.

## Questions:
* What kind of data should I use for this?
* How many data should I use for this?
* When & where can I achieve this toic?
* Heard about AlphaGo used similar framework(tree ensemble works with nerual network), interesting coincidence.
