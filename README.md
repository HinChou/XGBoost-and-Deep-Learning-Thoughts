### Question:
* Is LSTM better than CNN or RNN for time series analysis?
* What is GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks)?
* What is collaborative filtering recommendation?

## Combining XGBoost and Deep Learning Algorithms:
* Use boosting algorithm for framework. 
* Set weak learner(aka base leaner) as one hidden layer ANN(LSTM, CNN or RNN). 
* Set low learning rate and use CV or OOB for predictive ability testing.

## Questions:
* What kind of data should I use for this?
